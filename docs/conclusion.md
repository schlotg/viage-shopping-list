# Viage Shopping List Tutorial

## Conclusion

### Size
At this point we have a very functional application. If you type ```npm run build``` you will see that the final Javascript file size of bundle.js is 19kb and the index.html file is 321 bytes. That is remarkably small compared to the same app built in most other frameworks.

### Amount of Code
The amount of coding required to produce this app is on par with most frameworks if not less. However, the amount of framework knowledge required to effectively use Viage is small. Viage should work with most Javascript libraries out of the box. The Component / Service model is reasonably effective at keeping code organized, resusable, maintainable, and scalable.
